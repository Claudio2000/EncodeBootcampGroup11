Group 11 Week 3 Weekend Project

This week Group 11 are deciding where to go on holiday. They have five beach towns to chose from. 

To make the decision Group 11 are going to vote using a Tokenized Ballot. 

First TokenizedBallot.sol was written as the ballot contract.
MyERC20Votes.sol is used as the underlying token contract.
Both are tested using TokenBallotTest.ts

[christopherdick:~/git/solidity_playground]$ npx hardhat test ./tests/TokenBallotTest.ts


  Tokenized Ballot
    When the ballot contract is deployed
      ✔ Each proposal starts with 0 votes (41ms)
      ✔ uses a valid ERC20 as payment token (42ms)
    When a user is allocated a number of tokens
      ✔ The total supply increases appropriately
      ✔ The user has the right number of tokens but no votes
      When a user delegates to themselves
        ✔ The number of votes updates correctly
        ✔ The user is able to vote on a proposal (46ms)
      When a user sends tokens to another user
        ✔ Each user has the correct number of votes and tokens
        ✔ Users cannot vote with tokens they have sent
        When a token receiptant delegates to themselves
          ✔ The number of current votes updates correctly
          ✔ The number of past votes does not change
          ✔ The user is not able to vote on a proposal
          Winner is correct
            ✔ Winner is correct

Next, TokenBallotTest.ts is used to deploy the token contract, the ballot contract and mint tokens for each of the voters.
The token contract is deployed at https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xa5d739c9bc437c0cb02c0e7abc0fe55ea38c161c
The ballot contract is deployed at https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x4D29727e409Ab710964F99c6275Df5726582e4F0
