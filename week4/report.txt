----------------------------------

BACKEND SWAGGER PART
2) called the functions getBalance and totalSupply, which returns 0 as expected:
{
  "type": "BigNumber",
  "hex": "0x00"
}

	
{
  "type": "BigNumber",
  "hex": "0x00"
}

3) check the proposals:
They have all 0 votes as expected:
[
  "1) Surf has 0 Votes",
  "2) Climb has 0 Votes",
  "3) Sail has 0 Votes",
  "4) Snowboard has 0 Votes",
  "5) Kayak has 0 Votes"
]

4) Called function to mint and the function to delegate as a post each with the following body:
-------buyTokens-----------------
{
  "address": "0xFc4A978B4D7d3A931419d3d5cc0F7Efb408c8457",
  "value": "0.05",
  "signature": "string"
}

return body:
{
  "type": 2,
  "chainId": 5,
  "nonce": 188,
  "maxPriorityFeePerGas": {
    "type": "BigNumber",
    "hex": "0x59682f00"
  },
  "maxFeePerGas": {

}

----delegate----------------
{
  "address": "0xFc4A978B4D7d3A931419d3d5cc0F7Efb408c8457"
}

5) I called the function to check votingPower to my address and as expected I get block not mined error:
"ERC20Votes: block not yet mined"

6) Checked again after block is mined and I get 500 which is as expected:

500

7)
I distributed my voting in the follwing way:
[
  "1) Surf has 100 Votes",
  "2) Climb has 0 Votes",
  "3) Sail has 200 Votes",
  "4) Snowboard has 0 Votes",
  "5) Kayak has 200 Votes"
]
########################################
FEW UPDATES:
1) changed code in tokenizedBallot.sol so that it calculates the voting power reduced by 10**16. So if you a 18 decimal of the token you have 10 votes and once you cast all 10 votes the voting power returns 0 so you canÂ´t vote anymore
2) Following Chris idea, I changed the rest of the function such as totalBalance and votingPower so that they return an integer instead of a Hex
3) To avoid confusion I updated the vote backend function so you can vote for the actual proposal number listed, so proposal 0 becomes proposal 1 and proposal 4, proposal 5 and so on.
#############################################
Now when I check the voting power I got 0 as expected. If I try to vote, I get the expected error message: \"message\":\"execution reverted: No Voting Power\",

---------------------
For frontend, I implemented a InstructionsComponent.jsx file that has the following key functions:

1) TokenBalance()
2) getBalance(signer, setLoading, setTxData) 
3) GetResults()
4) getResults(signer, setLoading, setTxData)
5) RequestTokens()
6) requestTokens(signer, signature, setLoading, setTxData)
7) Vote()
8) vote(signer, signature, setLoading, setTxData)

The images in the folder show the output of the frontend so far. 

It's very ugly and it's missing:
1) customised voting
2) self delegation

Next steps are to improve that...
